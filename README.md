✅ Real-World Use Cases  

- 🧑‍🎓 Study Companion for Students
  Quickly ask ChatGPT questions, solve doubts, or summarize concepts during study sessions—no need to switch tabs or touch the keyboard.

- 🧓 Voice-Based Assistant for Elderly or Non-Tech Users
  Ideal for seniors or those unfamiliar with tech—just say the wake word and give a voice command to check the news, weather, or ask questions.

- 🤫 Distraction-Free Research Assistant
  Instead of browsing and getting distracted, ask questions or search Google quietly via voice—staying focused on the task at hand.

- 🎤 Voice-Activated Desktop for Developers During Coding
  While coding, ask the assistant for syntax help, documentation, or general debugging advice via ChatGPT—no screen-switching required.

AI Assistant with Face Recognition + Google + ChatGPT Integration
This project is a multimodal AI assistant that combines face recognition, voice interaction, Google search, and ChatGPT responses to provide a personalized, intelligent assistant experience. It supports real-time face authentication and performs voice-command-based task execution with the help of OpenAI's GPT model and Google APIs.

Features
- Face Recognition-Based Access Control
- Uses a webcam to authenticate the user via real-time face recognition using face_recognition and OpenCV.
- AI-Powered Chat & Query Handling

After authentication, the assistant listens for voice input, converts it to text, and intelligently responds using:
- Google Search (for general knowledge/factual queries)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI API) (for conversational and creative tasks)

Voice Interaction
The assistant speaks its responses using pyttsx3 (text-to-speech), creating a smooth interactive experience.

Wake Word Detection
It can remain passive until a specific "wake word" (like "hey assistant") is spoken.
